# Computer Architecture

This repository contains the solutions to assignments given in IIT Delhi's computer architecture course.

## Lessons Learned

- Assembly Programming
- ARM Assembly (Simulated on **ARMSim#**)
- Hardware Description
- VHDL (Simulated using **Questa Intel FPGA** and synthesized using **Quartus**)

## Features

- Implementation of mergesort (on strings) in ARM Assembly.
- A processor which executes a subset of ARM instructions designed in VHDL.
