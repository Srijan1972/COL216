The addresses of the strings are first stored in a separate list and then the mergesort algorithm simply rearranges the pointers instead of copying the strings. 
An auxillary space is used to store the sorted (pointer) list while merging and then the sorted pointer list is then copied back to the original pointer list.

Registers used:
    r0: Used to store address of string in compare, address of pointer in merge and mergesort
    r1: Used to store address of string in compare, address of pointer in merge, buffer register in mergesort
    r2: Stores duplicate sensitivity, and also gives result of compare
    r3: Contains 32 or 0 depending on r2
    r4: Used to store character in compare, size of list in merge and mergesort
    r5: Used to store character in compare, size of list in merge and buffer register in mergesort
    r6: Stores duplicate removal
    r7: Used to store end of list in merge, and also as a buffer register in merge
    r8: Used to store end of list in merge, and also as a buffer register in mergesort
    r9: Used to store address of auxillary pointer list
    r10: Number of duplicates in merge
    r11: Temporary data storing in merge

Running Instructions:
    Legacy SWI instructions have been used so only this option to be ticked.
    The order in which files should be loaded into ARMSim# is (from top to bottom):
        main.s
        mergesort.s
        merge.s
        compare.s
    Input is taken from stdin and output is displayed on stdout

Sample test cases:
Keeping duplicates:

    Enter 0 for case sensitivity and 1 for case insensitivity: 1
    Enter 0 to remove duplicates and 1 to keep duplicates: 1
    Enter the size of the list (Max size 100): 24
    Enter the strings in the list: (Each string should have a maximum length of 100)

Removing duplicates:

    Enter 0 for case sensitivity and 1 for case insensitivity: 0
    Enter 0 to remove duplicates and 1 to keep duplicates: 0
    Enter the size of the list (Max size 100): 24
    Enter the strings in the list: (Each string should have a maximum length of 100)
